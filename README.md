# 5e Statblock Sheet
Simple D&D 5e NPC sheets that look like stat blocks (until you want to edit something).\
It has all the limitations of the great old Monster Blocks and more!

## How to use
Once installed, you'll be able to choose two additional sheets for NPCs (the 2014 version and the 2024 version). They're not very practical for complex monsters, but they're small and nice.

If you switch them to edit mode, they revert to the default dnd5e sheet, where you can actually tinker with everything.
